## Mob programming -- Code review

Lots of code shops practice code mobbing! This is like pair programming, but with ~five navigators and one driver, with drivers swapping out over a period of time. In your group of six (assigned and posted in slack), there should be two projects represented.

## Instructions

1. Pick one of the projects, and everybody clone it. Everybody take 15 minutes to look over the codebase individually, looking for places to refactor (WET code, magic strings, unclear naming, code that could be moved into functions with declarative names).

2. One of the owners of the repo drives, while the rest of the mob navigates. Make a new branch called `refactor-lab`. Decide as a group which files or sections to address for refactor, and improve the codebase as a group.

3. Make a PR to master, to be submitted to Canvas.

4. After 90 minutes, switch to the other represented project, and repeat step two.

## Points Break Down

| :--------------- | ----------: |
| PR for project 1 |           5 |
