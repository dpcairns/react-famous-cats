## Mob programming -- Code review

Lots of code shops practice code mobbing! This is like pair programming, but with ~five navigators and one driver, with drivers swapping out over a period of time. In your group of six (assigned and posted in slack), there should be two projects represented.

## Instructions

1. Pick one of the projects, and everybody clone it. Everybody take 15 minutes to look over the codebase individually, looking for places to refactor (WET code, magic strings, unclear naming, code that could be moved into functions with declarative names). Even the best projects require refactoring: decisions you made in during a rushed, four-day project week could always be improved! As you read the code, it might help to imagine you were hired onto a job to replace a developer who left, and are asked to begin work on the app they were working on.

2. Take about 5 minutes to share, present, and discuss the parts that could use refactoring.

3. One of the owners of the repo drives, while the rest of the mob navigates. Make a new branch called `refactor-lab`. Decide as a group which files or sections to address for refactor, and improve the codebase as a group.

4. Make a PR to master, to be submitted to Canvas.

5. After 90 minutes, switch to the other represented project, and repeat step two.
