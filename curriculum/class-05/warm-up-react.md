# Refactor warm up!

-Pull today's class from the repo. Refactor the rick and morty app to use a CharacterItem component.
 
 -Don't forget to `cd` into the rick and morty repo `npm i` and `npm start` to get the app running. 

-If you have extra time, move the search input into its own component too. Hey, why not refactor the fetch call into its own service function too?
