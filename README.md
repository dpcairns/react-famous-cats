# Bootcamp 2

## Developer Focus

### Design (Technical & Product)

Upfront planning to figure out problem _before_ coding

### Balance

1. Practice to grow: `competent` --> `proficient` --> `fluent`
1. Know how to progress when you don't know

### Skills

1. Analyze
1. Synthesize
1. Integrate

### Diagnose Problems

Improve ability to solve problems, and/or get effective help

1. Speak in terms of expected vs actual
    1. What are you trying to accomplish? 
    1. What is goal?
    1. What step are you on?
2. Feedback Discovered
    1. What have you noticed so far?
    1. What have you tried?
    1. What has or has not worked?
3. Avoid these types of explaining:
    1. Pleading Your Case
    1. Memoirs and Histories

## Class

### Readings

More readings, try and keep up!

First week is heaviest.

### Code Challenges

There are daily code challenges:

1. Work on these starting end of class
1. Collaborative start, individual finish
1. Try and be complete by next morning
1. (Don't start paired labs till morning)
1. Final submissions due before start of project week

### Warm Ups

1. 15 minute challenges + discussion at start of class
1. Involves guessing as to what code might do
1. Includes other languages
1. Not graded

### Retros

In lieu of journal assignments, you will have a daily "retro" to complete.
=======
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
