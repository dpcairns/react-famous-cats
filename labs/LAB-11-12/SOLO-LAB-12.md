# Solo Build: Room Chat

Let's build an online Chat App!

## User Stories

As a user, I want to...

1. be able to add a chat room 
1. see a list of available chat rooms
1. remove a chat room, STRETCH: if I created it

## Technical Notes

Store the `uid` as an `owner` property for each room. 

STRETCH: Don't render the delete button if `owner` doesn't match the current user's `uid`
