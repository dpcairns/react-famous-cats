# Solo Build: Chat Room

Let's build an online Chat App!

## User Stories

As a user, I want to...

1. go to a chat room page from the home page
1. send a chat messages
1. see a realtime list of chat messages from all users with:
    - message
    - user profile image and name
    - date and time of the message

## Technical Notes

In order to see information about other users, you will need to save
user profile information by adding a `signInSuccessWithAuthResult` 
callback to firebaseui sign-in/up.
